== Getting started

LibGDX use https://gradle.org[gradle] as a build system.
You can use the https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html[official setup app] to create your game.
Instead  LibGDX-addons propose a gradle plugin to take care of all gradle setup,
for all platform (Currently supported: Desktop and Android) so you don't have to manage it or update
your gradle script.

=== Setup your game

Create your first game by using https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ].
Click in `File` > `New Project`

Pick `Gradle` then tick `Kotlin DSL build script`, choose `Kotlin/JVM` and go to the next screen by clicking `Next`.

Fill the information asked and click `Next` until IntelliJ create your project.

Open the file `build.gradle.kts` and paste this configuration into.
It adds necessary repositories for dependencies and add the https://github.com/dwursteisen/libgdx-addons/tree/master/libgdx-gradle-plugin[gradle libgdx plugin].

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin,subs=attributes+]
----

buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.github.dwursteisen.libgdx-addons:libgdx-gradle-plugin:016e8b7")
    }
    // <1>
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url = uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/") }
        maven { url = uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/") }
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}

allprojects {
    // <2>
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url = uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/") }
        maven { url = uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/") }
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}

apply(plugin = "libgdx")
----
<1> Add dependency repositories for plugins
<2> Add dependency repositories for all modules

Run the command `gradlew build`: it will download gradle if needed and download all dependencies and create the minimal setup.
Once done, it might be long depending of your Internet connection, refresh the project in IntelliJ.

=== Run your game

Your game project is now ready!
A new https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html[Run Configuration] just appear in your IntelliJ.
Click on `Add Configuration` and check `Application` run configurations. You will see a run configuration added in IntelliJ
to run your game.

NOTE: The first run will crash! Because you need to create your first game class.
See bellow for more information.

=== Draw your first texture

Grab an image and copy it into the `assets` directory of the `core` module.
You can find free image / sprite sheet on the https://opengameart.org/content/a-blocky-dungeon[OpenGameArt.org].

Run the command `./gradlew build`, the command will generate a new class `Assets` that will
contains all of your assets name.

NOTE: The use of the `Assets` object is not mandatory. But if your rename one of your assets,
it's practical to have a compilation error instead of your game crashing.

Create your game into the `core` directory and use it in `MainClass.kt`.

.MyGame.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
include::samples/step2/core/src/main/kotlin/libgdx/MyGame.kt[tags="body"]
----

.MainClass.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
include::samples/step2/desktop/src/main/kotlin/libgdx/MainClass.kt[tags="body"]
----

If you run your game, the texture will be displayed on the screen.

=== Increase your feedback loop

It's important to have a quick feedback loop while developing a game.
For example, what's the point of restarting your game when you just updated
a texture from your game?

To enable this feature, you need to add a dependency to
the https://github.com/dwursteisen/libgdx-addons/tree/master/core-addons[libgdx core-addons].

Add this into your `build.gradle.kts` then refresh the project in your IDE:

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin,subs=attributes+]
----
project(":core") {
    dependencies {
        implementation("com.github.dwursteisen.libgdx-addons:core-addons:{gitCommit}")
    }
}
----

You can now update your game to use the asset manager of libgdx with `RefreshableTexture`.

.MyGame.kt
[source,kotlin]
----
include::samples/step3/core/src/main/kotlin/libgdx/MyGame.kt[tags="body"]
----
<1> Replace the default Texture Loader with the RefreshableTexture Loader;
<2> Force to load all assets before rendering the game;
<3> Clear the screen;
<4> Getting the texture from the asset manager.

Run your game and while the game is running, apply a modification on the texture file.
As soon as you save the file, the texture will be updated in your game.

image::media/create_game_05.gif[]

NOTE: The asset manager is not mandatory. But by using it, you can use the `RefreshableTexture`
for the desktop version of your game and the default texture loader for your android game without
having to change your whole code base.

=== Setup a entity engine

A game is a lot of different entities who share a lot of common behaviours. For example, the player
and an enemy have bot a position. They have both a size too. You can create a class that both will
inherit. But it will increase your code complexity. Instead, you can compose your entities of different
properties: an entity can be a player with a size and a position. An enemy is an entity with a size, a position,
some other capacities.

[Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) is one entity engine for libGDX. It is very easy to setup in your project.
Add ashley as dependencies of your project then refresh it in your IDE.

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin,subs=attributes+]
----
project(":core") {
    dependencies {
        implementation("com.github.dwursteisen.libgdx-addons:core-addons:{gitCommit}")
        implementation("com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:{versionAshley}")
    }
}
